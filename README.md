Analyzing the Effectiveness of Carbon Pricing Across Industries & Regions
ðŸ“„ Project Summary

This repository contains an analysis of how carbon pricing mechanisms (via effective carbon rates) correlate with emissions and GDP across industries and geographic regions. The goal is to assess whether carbon pricing is effective in reducing emissions, controlling for economic growth.

Key datasets include GDP data, emission statistics, and effective carbon rate (ECR) data from OECD and World Bank sources.

ðŸ›  Methods & Workflow
1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning

Load GDP, emissions, and ECR datasets.

Clean and standardize formats (e.g. date formats, country/industry labels).

Handle missing values, duplicates, and potential inconsistencies.

2. Data Merging & Feature Engineering

Join datasets into a combined table keyed by country / year / industry.

Create derived metrics (e.g. emissions per GDP unit, carbon rate per unit emission).

Create lagged features or growth rates where relevant.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and distributions.

Correlation analyses among ECR, emissions, and GDP.

Visualizations: time series trends, scatter plots, heatmaps, industry-level comparisons.

4. Modeling / Statistical Tests

Regression models (e.g. fixed effects, panel regressions) to test the effect of ECR on emissions, controlling for GDP growth.

Diagnostics and validation (residuals, multicollinearity, goodness-of-fit).

Robustness checks (e.g. lagged independent variables, sub-sample analyses).

5. Interpretation & Policy Insights

Interpreting coefficient estimates: Does a higher carbon rate lead to lower emissions?

Heterogeneity across industries or regions.

Policy relevance: how strong are the effects? Are they economically meaningful?

ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings & Implications

(Fill this section after your analysis â€” here are example placeholders.)

Carbon pricing effectiveness: A statistically significant negative association between ECR and emissions intensity (emissions/GDP) in several industries.

Heterogeneity: The carbon rate effect is stronger in heavy-polluting sectors (e.g. energy, transportation) than in service industries.

Economic trade-offs: Some countries show mild GDP growth dampening effects under higher ECR but overall net benefit in long-term decarbonization.

Policy implications: Suggest phased increases in carbon rates with sector-specific targeting, accompanied by subsidies or offsets in sensitive sectors.
